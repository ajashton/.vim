# .vim

It's my `.vim`! Hooray. It changes often, but in general some notes:

* Stuff uses [Pathogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen).
* [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), [jshint](http://www.jshint.com/), [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes),
  [git](http://git-scm.com/) are required
* I usually use this stuff with [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)
